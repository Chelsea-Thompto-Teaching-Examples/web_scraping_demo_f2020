# web_scraping_demo_f2020
Two small web scraping scripts to accompany Sam Lavigne's "Scrapism" project: https://scrapism.lav.io/ 

These files were generated for the Fall 2020 section of Art 107 @ SJSU to accompany the in-class demo.

A few notes:

Use the "Inspect" and/or "Developer Tools" in Chrome to view page source.

Append "> filename.txt" to your script command to generate a text file containing the script output. (Replace "filename" with desired name.)
